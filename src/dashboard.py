To whom it concerns:

With over 15 years of experience in Data Engineering and Machine Learning, I bring extensive expertise in developing and implementing data solutions that perfectly align with the requirements of your position as Product Owner for Data & Analytics.

Based on my self-assessment and project experience, I have developed significant proficiency in cloud technologies and data engineering. Over the past 7+ years, I have implemented cloud-based pipelines in AWS and OpenShift, utilizing technologies such as AWS Sagemaker, Snowflake, and Azure Cognitive Services, which are also relevant in the environment you have described. My skills, as visualized in the radar diagram, highlight a strong focus on Data Engineering, Data Modeling, and ETL processes, which I have applied in various projects, including the development of a clinical data catalog and a bioinformatics pipeline.

In the area of product development and management, I have led a team as Product Owner for the Analytics Landing Page, which developed innovative data products used in business intelligence and cognitive search functionalities. Particularly relevant to your requirements for data architecture and prototyping is my experience in the agile development of data solutions within a multinational environment for one of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies. In this role, I also implemented a CI/CD system for genome assemblies operating at a petabyte scale â€” clear evidence of my ability to successfully manage complex data structures and modern technologies.

In addition to technical skills (Cloud Computing, Data Visualization, NLP, Snowflake, and Python), my self-assessment also highlights strong soft skills, particularly in leadership, creative thinking, and project management. I have demonstrated these abilities in various leadership roles, most recently as Interim Head of Data Science and Head of Digital Lab, where I coached agile teams and led digital initiatives.

My analytical thinking and problem-solving skills, as shown in my self-assessment, support me in developing efficient solutions that meet both business and technology requirements.

With my outstanding communication skills in both German and English, I can seamlessly work in an international environment and foster collaboration between business and IT.

I would be thrilled to bring my comprehensive knowledge and diverse experience to your team and look forward to a personal conversation to discuss how I can optimally support your companyâ€™s goals.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,

Dr. Mathew Divine
