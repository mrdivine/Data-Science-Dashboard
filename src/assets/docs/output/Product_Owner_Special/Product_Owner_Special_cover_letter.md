Dear Hiring Team,

I am excited to express my interest in the Product Owner Special position and share how my extensive experience aligns with the key requirements of the role.

Throughout my 15+ years in the fields of traditional machine learning and generative AI in the biomedical and Pharma domains, I have honed my skills in AI strategy, design thinking facilitation, and qualitative user research. These experiences have equipped me with the ability to translate complex data analysis into actionable business insights, a crucial aspect of the Product Owner Special role.

One of the projects that directly showcases my leadership and team coordination skills is my role as the Project Lead of CRM Cleaning and Development of AI-first Web-Scraping Technology. This experience parallels the requirement for leading projects related to container platform management and team coordination. While my direct experience in container platform management projects may be limited, my proven track record in driving digital transformation initiatives and mentoring teams demonstrates my readiness to take on new challenges.

Moreover, my technical expertise in Openshift, Kubernetes, and Azure technologies is evident through projects like being the Product Owner of Analytics Landing Page and developing Bioinformatics Pipelines for Genome Assembly Algorithms. These projects highlight my solid technical understanding and hands-on experience with cloud services, aligning well with the essential technical requirements of the role.

While my experience lies predominantly in the biomedical and Pharma domains, my work in digital transformation projects within the pharmaceutical industry has provided me with insights into regulatory compliance similar to the public sector. This exposure positions me to understand the unique challenges and requirements of government projects, even though I have not directly worked in the public sector.

I am currently residing in Germany, fluent in both German and English, and open to security checks and occasional business travel, meeting the essential residency and language requirements of the role. My dedication to leveraging AI to solve complex problems and deliver measurable results reflects my commitment to driving innovation and growth within a team.

In conclusion, while I may have limited direct experience in some specific areas, my diverse background and proven ability to adapt and learn quickly make me a strong candidate for the Product Owner Special role. I am eager to bring my unique perspective and skills to your team and contribute to the success of your projects.

Sincerely,
