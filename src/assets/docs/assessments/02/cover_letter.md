Dear Hiring Manager,

I am thrilled to express my interest in the Data Engineer position at your esteemed company. With over 15 years of experience in the fields of traditional machine learning and generative AI within the biomedical and Pharma domains, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team.

My extensive experience in cloud development and data processing tools on AWS, including AWS SageMaker, aligns closely with the requirement for proficiency in major cloud platforms. For instance, as the Project Lead of CRM Cleaning and Development of AI-first Web-Scraping Technology at Freelancer, I successfully orchestrated ETL workflows and real-time data streams using tools like Apache Spark and Kafka.

Furthermore, my significant expertise with data processing frameworks such as Apache Spark, Kafka, and Airflow is evident in projects like the Development of Bioinformatics Pipelines for Genome Assembly Algorithms at BI X GmbH. These experiences have honed my skills in managing ETL workflows and real-time data streams, aligning well with the strong experience requirement.

While my familiarity with model deployment and serving technologies like AWS SageMaker is showcased in projects such as the Bespoke Drug Discovery and Market Intelligence Web App at BI X GmbH, I acknowledge the room for further deepening my knowledge in this area to meet the essential criterion.

Regarding DevOps practices for cloud environments, I have gained experience in CI/CD and containerization with Docker, as seen in projects like the Data Science Hackathon Utilizing Generative AI to Generate Novel Medicinal Molecules at BI X GmbH. However, I am eager to enhance my skills in Kubernetes and Infrastructure-as-Code using tools like Terraform or CloudFormation.

In conclusion, I believe my background in AI strategy, design thinking facilitation, and qualitative user research can compensate for any gaps in my technical skills. I am dedicated to fostering a culture of innovation and growth while leveraging AI to solve complex problems. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to your team and drive digital transformation initiatives.

Sincerely,
