Dear Hiring Manager,

I am thrilled to express my interest in the Business Analyst position with your esteemed organization. With over 15 years of experience in data science, AI strategy, and user research, I believe my background aligns well with the requirements of the role.

One of the key requirements for the Business Analyst role is Business Process Modeling. I have led a CRM data normalization project and implemented genAI-first web crawling strategies, which directly demonstrate my expertise in this area. Additionally, my experience in Data Analysis and Reporting is extensive, as seen in my work developing ETL processes for clinical data cataloging and utilizing ontologies for data normalization.

While my project management skills have been honed through leading multiple projects, including digital strategy development and document generation systems, there is always room for growth in this area to better align with the role's requirements.

I believe my experience in translating complex data analysis into actionable insights, mentoring teams, and driving digital transformation initiatives can significantly benefit your organization. My proficiency in German and English further enhances my ability to collaborate effectively.

In areas where there may be gaps, my commitment to continuous learning and adaptability allows me to quickly acquire new skills and knowledge to complement my existing expertise.

I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team and leverage AI to drive innovation and growth. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
