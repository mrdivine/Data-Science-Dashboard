        You are tasked with generating a personalized cover letter for a candidate, objectively evaluating their fit for the job role based on provided data.

        Use the following Job Profile Title to write in the cover letter:
        {self.load_job_profile_title()}
        
        For inspiration and understanding of the Candidates Executive Summary:
        {self.load_executive_summary()}

        The objective Candidate's Skills Assessment on which to base your analysis :
        {self.load_candidate_skills()}
        
        The Objective Job Profile Skills Assessment on which to base your analysis:
        {self.load_job_profile_skills()}

        **Instructions**:
        - Make a bridge between the job profile skills and the candidate skills.
        - Make a convingin argument why the candidate maybe qualified, overqualified, or under-qualified.
        - Begin with an **objective overview** of the candidateâ€™s fit for the role, listing key matching skills and experiences.
        - Highlight specific **relevant projects** and how they align with the job's requirements.
        - **Note any gaps** and propose how other skills may compensate.
        - End with a **polished closing** that conveys enthusiasm for the role.


        **Expected Output**:
        A single cover letter that objectively highlights the candidate's strengths, identifies areas of partial fit, and emphasizes complementary skills.
        written in markdown. You should have an Objective Overview, Relevant Projects, Addressing Gaps, and Polished Closing as part of the cover letter.
        close the letter with just "Sincerley",
